# Bushfire Prevention Simulation

This is an Ethereum dapp that simulates the proposed wireless ssensor network architecture to help prevent bushfires.

## Note on contract size

It cannot exceed 24KB in size!

One way to get around this: the so-called 'Diamond Standard' (https://dev.to/mudgen/ethereum-s-maximum-contract-size-limit-is-solved-with-the-diamond-standard-2189).

## TODO

* Make new contract for managing the node roles and for bushfire detecting operations.
* Make approval automatic.
